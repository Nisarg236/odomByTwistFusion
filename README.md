# odom_by_twist_fusion
This package subscribes twist stamped message from two different IMUs and performs fusion using a kalman filter and then calculates the odometry (x,y and theta). It then publishes the calculated Odometry and fused velocities.

The code is implemented in C++ and works with ROS2. Will upload in sometime.
